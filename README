Because the site loads a local file, you need to spin up a development server to
avoid CORS requests failing. For more info, see Mozilla's page on the error:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp

An easy way to do this is with npm, if you already have it installed:

$ npx http-server /path/to/project -o -p 8080

IDEs and text editors also provide extensions that allow you to do this.
