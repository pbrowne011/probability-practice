A site for practicing probability problems stored in a JSON file.


About
---
I set this up for myself to practice probability questions. I realized how
out-of-practice I had become, and want a readily accessible method for
practicing basic probability questions.

Other solutions exist (MathAcademy, Khan Academy, others), but this fills my
specific desire of textbook problems in a simple web interface.


Development

Because the site loads a local file, you need to spin up a development server to
avoid CORS requests failing. For more info, see Mozilla's page on the error:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp

An easy way to do this is with npm, if you already have it installed:

$ npx http-server /path/to/project -o -p 8080

IDEs and text editors also provide extensions that allow you to do this.
